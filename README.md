# Dirt to Dollars - Predicting Used Bulldozer Prices

**Dirt to Dollars** is a machine learning project that predicts the prices of used bulldozers based on historical auction data. The model leverages regression techniques and feature engineering to provide insights into the pricing trends of heavy equipment.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
- 📊 Developed a regression model to estimate used bulldozer prices from auction data.
- 🛠️ Applied machine learning algorithms like **Random Forest Regression**.
- 🔍 Performed feature engineering to extract key insights from the data.
- 🔄 Utilized **cross-validation** for model performance optimization.
- 💡 Focused on improving **price transparency** in heavy equipment sales.

---

## 📚 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and engineered features from raw auction data.
- **Modeling:** Built and tuned multiple regression models, including Random Forest Regression.
- **Evaluation:** Used metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and cross-validation for robust performance evaluation.
- **Insights:** Visualizations and insights into which features affect bulldozer pricing the most.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
